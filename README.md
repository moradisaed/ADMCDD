# AADCDD

__"Small infrared target detection using absolute average difference weighted by cumulative directional derivatives (AADCDD)"__

If you are using this code in your researches, kindly cite the following paper:

[Aghaziyarati, Saeid, Saed Moradi, and Hasan Talebi. "Small infrared target detection using absolute average difference weighted by cumulative directional derivatives." Infrared Physics & Technology 101 (2019): 78-87.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1350449518309654)

The code is implemented using OpenCV 3.4 in Ubuntu 18.04 environment. It is not tested for other OpenCV versions, but it should work. 
### Prerequisites
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

### Setup
Build OpenCV from source (if you want to enable QT option to zoom on images and see the pixels value), or just simply use the following command in terminal:

```shell
$ sudo apt install libopencv-dev python3-opencv
```
